AI JOURNAL ENTRY WEEK 2

This week, I made consistent use of AI to assist with my coursework. Specifically, I relied on AI to support my practice with 
Python programming fundamentals. For example, I asked AI to help me write and refine small code snippets that covered topics such 
as list operations, conditional statements, loops, and parallel list handling. These exercises included toggling values, searching lists,
building reports, and creating simple menu loops. AI was especially useful in clarifying step-by-step logic when working with loops and conditionals.
It helped me identify the most efficient ways to construct solutions without skipping over important details. The process of breaking down each exercise 
with AI’s assistance improved my understanding of control flow and data structures in Python


AI JOURNAL WEEK 3

This week was the week my AI usage was  extensive as it was i really needed help soving some of the code in the homeowork i kept 
getting small errors. This week I used AI mainly to help me understand and complete some of my programming exercises. 
For example, I was working on a set of Python functions for a library management project, and I used AI to see examples of how to 
write functions that handle lists and check conditions. It helped me structure my code and reminded me of some Python techniques 
I had forgotten, like using enumerate() for loops and list comprehensions.I also used AI to double-check my logic in some of the exercises
where I had to track book availability and checkout status. It was useful for spotting small mistakes I might have missed, like off-by-one 
errors or forgetting to update a list.Overall, AI helped me be more confident about my solutions and saved me some time when I wasn’t sure how to approach
a problem. I didn’t use it to copy answers, just to get guidance and examples that helped me think through the problems myself.

AI JOURNAL WEEK 4

This week, I used AI to help me complete my Python exercises for class. I asked for guidance on creating classes like Book, Member, and Shelf
, and it helped me write the methods correctly and check for edge cases. I also used AI to double-check my code with quick assertions to make 
sure everything worked as expected. Additionally, I asked for explanations of the code so I could understand why each method worked, not just 
copy it. Using AI this way saved me time and made it easier to stay organized while learning.
