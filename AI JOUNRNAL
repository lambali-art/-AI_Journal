AI JOURNAL ENTRY WEEK 2

This week, I made consistent use of AI to assist with my coursework. Specifically, I relied on AI to support my practice with 
Python programming fundamentals. For example, I asked AI to help me write and refine small code snippets that covered topics such 
as list operations, conditional statements, loops, and parallel list handling. These exercises included toggling values, searching lists,
building reports, and creating simple menu loops. AI was especially useful in clarifying step-by-step logic when working with loops and conditionals.
It helped me identify the most efficient ways to construct solutions without skipping over important details. The process of breaking down each exercise 
with AI’s assistance improved my understanding of control flow and data structures in Python


AI JOURNAL WEEK 3

This week was the week my AI usage was  extensive as it was i really needed help soving some of the code in the homeowork i kept 
getting small errors. This week I used AI mainly to help me understand and complete some of my programming exercises. 
For example, I was working on a set of Python functions for a library management project, and I used AI to see examples of how to 
write functions that handle lists and check conditions. It helped me structure my code and reminded me of some Python techniques 
I had forgotten, like using enumerate() for loops and list comprehensions.I also used AI to double-check my logic in some of the exercises
where I had to track book availability and checkout status. It was useful for spotting small mistakes I might have missed, like off-by-one 
errors or forgetting to update a list.Overall, AI helped me be more confident about my solutions and saved me some time when I wasn’t sure how to approach
a problem. I didn’t use it to copy answers, just to get guidance and examples that helped me think through the problems myself.

AI JOURNAL WEEK 4

This week, I used AI to help me complete my Python exercises for class. I asked for guidance on creating classes like Book, Member, and Shelf
, and it helped me write the methods correctly and check for edge cases. I also used AI to double-check my code with quick assertions to make 
sure everything worked as expected. Additionally, I asked for explanations of the code so I could understand why each method worked, not just 
copy it. Using AI this way saved me time and made it easier to stay organized while learning.

AI JOURNAL WEEK 5

This week, AI really helped me improve my project work. It guided me through debugging Python functions, making sure my code ran smoothly 
and produced clear outputs. It also helped me clean up my formatting and made my README file more organized and easy to follow. Overall,
using AI made the development process much faster and less stressful.

AI JOUNRAL WEEK 6

This week, I used AI a lot to help me write and organize Python classes for my assignments. I went through exercises creating classes 
like Book, Member, Loan, and Catalog, and AI helped me make instance methods, class methods, and static methods correctly. It was really 
helpful for understanding the differences between them and seeing how to structure my code. I also used AI to quickly check my code and get 
simple examples for testing.

AI JOURNAL WEEK 7 

This week I used AI to help me write and debug several Python functions for my class assignments, including validating ISBNs, 
handling exceptions, and writing unit tests. I also practiced converting legacy assert statements to proper exception handling and 
created end-to-end test cases for a catalog and loan system. The AI was really helpful in showing me how to structure try/except/else 
blocks and subtests in unittest, which made my code cleaner and easier to understand. I also used it to clarify small details like proper 
error messages and handling user input safely.

AI JOURNAL WEEK 8

This week, I used AI to help me work through my Python class exercises, especially for creating subclasses of `Book` and `Member`,
implementing polymorphic methods, and handling library checkout logic. I also got guidance on writing small demos and unit tests to make
sure my overrides and late fee calculations worked correctly. It was really helpful for seeing how inheritance and polymorphism play out
in a real program. Here’s a link to my chat where I built most of the library system.
