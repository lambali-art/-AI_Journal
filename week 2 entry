AI JOURNAL ENTRY 

This week, I made consistent use of AI to assist with my coursework. Specifically, I relied on AI to support my practice with 
Python programming fundamentals. For example, I asked AI to help me write and refine small code snippets that covered topics such 
as list operations, conditional statements, loops, and parallel list handling. These exercises included toggling values, searching lists,
building reports, and creating simple menu loops. AI was especially useful in clarifying step-by-step logic when working with loops and conditionals.
It helped me identify the most efficient ways to construct solutions without skipping over important details. The process of breaking down each exercise 
with AIâ€™s assistance improved my understanding of control flow and data structures in Python
