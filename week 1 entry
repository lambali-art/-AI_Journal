AI Journal Entry 

This week I continued to use AI as a supplementary tool while working on programming exercises. Specifically, I asked AI to explain key Python concepts, such as string manipulation 
and input/output formatting. I also requested additional examples of code to reinforce my understanding, but I did not use AI to directly solve or submit any of the assigned exercises. 
I did not rely on AI for debugging this week, as I wanted to practice identifying and resolving my own errors.Additionally, I conducted further comparisons across different AI platforms, 
including ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. I found that the responses varied in both style and depth of explanation, even when identical prompts were used. With Claude,
I explored ways to improve the clarity of my test setup, while ChatGPT proved the most consistent in aligning outputs with the goals of our analysis. 
This process reinforced my understanding of how prompt wording and model design influence the quality of responses.Overall, I learned the importance of approaching AI as a tool 
for exploration and support rather than as a replacement for critical thinking. By comparing outputs and testing across platforms, I gained insight into the biases and tendencies 
of different models, which reminded me of how human perspectives can also shape interpretation and analysis.
